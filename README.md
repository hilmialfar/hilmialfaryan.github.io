 - [Product Department - Final Project MSIB Kampus Merdeka (Data, Business Analytics & Operations Bootcamp)](https://github.com/hilmialfar/Ruangguru-Project/blob/main/Final_Project_Ruangguru_Hilmi_Alfa_Ryan.ipynb)
   
   My final project is to process dummy data representing product departments of a fictitious E-Commerce company to help the company perform product optimization by    applying Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) during the data analysis process, machine learning modeling with K-Means Clustering algorithm, and data visualization in the form of dashboards/storytelling. The goal is to identify product categories that are popular and unpopular with customers. The results of K-Means Clustering modeling show 3 clusters, which are popular, moderately popular, and unpopular category clusters. Recommendations for companies to increase sales are to do promos or cross-selling of products that are unpopular to customers or reduce the number of products from the distributor.

    An online retail company based in the UK sells unique gifts for all occasions to different countries. In order to compete with competitors, they need to make decisions about what business strategies to use in the future. Therefore, it is necessary to find out how the company's future business will be in terms of revenue by data analysis and modeling time-series forecasting machine learning algorithms.
