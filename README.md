**Portfolio of Data Analysis and Tool Usage**

1. Product Department - Final Project MSIB Kampus Merdeka (Data, Business Analytics & Operations Bootcamp)
   
   The final project is to process dummy data representing product departments of a fictitious E-Commerce company to help the company perform product optimization by    applying Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) during the data analysis process, machine learning modeling with K-Means Clustering algorithm, and data visualization in the form of dashboards/storytelling. The goal is to identify product categories that are popular and unpopular with customers. The results of K-Means Clustering modeling show 3 clusters, which are popular, moderately popular, and unpopular category clusters. Recommendations for companies to increase sales are to do promos or cross-selling of products that are unpopular to customers or reduce the number of products from the distributor.
